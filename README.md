# 3dhubs-qa-challenge
Hi all , 
This is Hubs Qa Challenge Assignment. I automated the model uploading 
on https://www.hubs.com/manufacture/ using Python, Selenium and PyTest. I also use Allure for report the test results.
I tested assert text , assert button title , uploading file to sheet metal , uploading file to CNC metal and 
uploading the unsupported file. 
In the future , I would like add more test cases.
Thank you for this assignment.
